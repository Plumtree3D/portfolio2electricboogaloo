# portfolio

This is my actual portfolio and it rocks, I didn't want to make some sleek, corporate, bootstrap templated website and since I changed so much stuff to it I decided to make a new repository. 
I wanted something personal that would feel like the bright and colorful organised mess that I am.


This is also a place for experimentation, I will sometimes have this random cool idea that I have never done before and I just try to find the best way to make it work.
